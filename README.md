# CSCI 468 Lab 1 - LEX Introduction

This is the first lab for CSCI468. The example.l file can be run to create a simple scanner that will
scan an input file given as a command line argument. To run this code, place both test_file.txt and example.l
in a directory on a system with FLEX installed, and run the following commands.

make example
./example test_file.txt

FLEX 2.5.35 was used for this lab.
